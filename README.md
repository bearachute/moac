# So, I bet you are wondering why all the commits?

## There really isn't any easy explanation for it, just I need to keep my fingers nimble and loose. I have a lot of spare code laying around
## It *NEEDS* to be pushed somewhere so I don't forget. 

This time it's more c, but I'm trying new things. :smile:
